## Overview

This week covered how to handle runtime errors gracefully using exceptions and explored core data structures provided by Java’s Collection Framework. You'll gain the ability to build error-resilient and data-driven applications.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Exception Handling Basics
- What are exceptions?
- Types: Checked vs. Unchecked
- `try` and `catch` blocks

### Day 2: Try-Catch-Finally and Nested Blocks
- Multiple catch blocks
- Nested try blocks
- The `finally` block

### Day 3: Custom Exceptions
- Creating user-defined exceptions
- Throwing and catching custom exceptions
- Use of `throw` and `throws`

### Day 4: Introduction to Collections

* What is the Collections Framework?
* Difference between Arrays and Collections
* Core interfaces: `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`
* Utility classes: `Collections`, `Arrays`

### Day 5: List Interface - ArrayList and LinkedList

* Characteristics of `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`
* Basic operations: add, remove, update, access
* Iterating using for-each loop, iterator, and listIterator

### Day 6: Set Interface - HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet

* Storing unique elements
* Differences in ordering and performance
* Use cases for each implementation

## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of Java syntax and OOP concepts
* JDK installed on your system
* An IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) for editing and running Java programs
